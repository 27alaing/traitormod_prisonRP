The Traitor Mode

Evil Factory's Traitor Mod is a server-sided mod that overrides the vanilla traitor mode. If a round starts with 3 or more players, one crew member will be selected as traitor and receives a new objective to prevent the crew from achieving their mission. On a bigger crew there can also be more than one traitor. The traitor is selected by a weight system, assuring that players who have not been traitors so often will be more likely to be chosen. 
Captains and Security Officers are always loyal to the ship and need to work together to find and restrain all traitors so the crew can complete their mission.

The Points System

Whenever a player gains a skill point, he also gains an amount of points. Traitors gain additional points by completing their objectives. Points will be persistently stored on the server and accumulate over rounds. If a player dies a number of times the amount of points will be reduced.
On every round half of a player's points will be given the character as experience and can be used to pick talents.
 
Traitor objectives

Main objectives - one of these will always be chosen

• Assassination     (700 points per target) 
The traitor will receive a target crew member to kill. Once the target is killed a new victim will be selected from all alive crew members.

Sub objectives - up to three of these may be chosen and can be done optionally to gain more points 

- Kidnapping        (4500 points)
Put a selected security guard in handcuffs for a given time.

• Poison Captain    (1500 points)
Inject the acting captain with poison.

• Steal Captain ID  (1500 points)
Take the ID card from your acting captain and put it in your inventory.

• Survive           (1000 points)
Be alive at the end of the round. (May clash with respawn-on)
 
Events

There is a chance that a random event fires some time during the round.
• Ballast Flora
A ballast tank will be infested with alien plants.

• Communications Offline (Currently deactivated to avoid confusion with text chat bug)
Will drastically reduce the range of all remote communication for the whole round.

Known issues

• Point loss on player deaths only happens if the player is dead while the round ends.
