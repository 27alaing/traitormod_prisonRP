__**Convict Station RP**__

> Evil Factory's Traitor Mod is a server-sided mod that overrides the vanilla traitor mode. If a round starts with enough players, some crew members may be selected as traitor and receive new objectives to prevent the rest of the crew from achieving their mission. The traitors are selected by a weight system, assuring that players who have not been traitors so often will be more likely to be chosen. 

This is a fork of Evil Factory's traitor mod built specifically for my convict station RP gamemode. More information will be added later.
